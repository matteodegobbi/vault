The generalization score is lower than the training score.
This is in agreement with the theory because according to the theory
the generalization error can be bigger than the training error. This is
not always guaranteed to be the case, it could happen that a model performs better on unseen data than on training data.
However in practice it's more common to have a lower generalization score
than training score because of overfitting.
