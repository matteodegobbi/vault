A running program brings a set of information that change over time
   
A snapshot of the associated information must be saved by the OS when the program loses processor ownership. Process context include:
- The program and the other memory contents managed by the program, in particular the program stack and the global variables
- The current values of the processor registers, including the PC that holds the address of the next instruction to execute.
- The OS resources currently used by the process (e.g. open files)
Â Process context must not be confused with the interrupt context: [[Context Switch VS Hardware Interrupt]].

 The OS has a list of PCBs (Process Control Block) to store this necessary info for all the processes, it would be necessary to copy all of the processes memory content when the process is switched but this is impossible, this is another reason for using [[Virtual Memory|virtual memory]], this way the actual content of the physical memory doesn't move and we just store the page table entries used by the process in the PCB.
 The PCB holds:
 - Program code
 - Program stack for local variables 
 - Static memory for global and static variables 
 - Heap memory
If the memory used by the process is large the context switch can take a long time.

The [[TLB]] must be flushed on context switch, this can be a problem for performance.

Ready: a process is able to execute instructions (not waiting for I/O etc)
Running: the scheduler has assigned a processor to this task and the task has total control of the processor
Wait: the task has requested an OS function and is waiting for the termination of the action and could not use the processor, while a process is waiting the OS will assign the processor another task.

A running process may be yielded by the OS which takes control of the processor to assign it to another task, this is done through an interrupt.
