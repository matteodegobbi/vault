#algorithms
Dynamic programming is an algorithmic technique used for solving combinatorial or optimization problems.

It's useful whenever we have problems with:
1. Optimal substructure (Optimal solutions to subproblems can be used to obtain an optimal solution to the whole problem)
2. Overlapping subproblems (repeated instances of the same subproblem)

This technique allows us to get polynomial time algorithms where naïve divide and conquer would yield exponential time algorithms.
